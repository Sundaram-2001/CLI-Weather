# 🌤️ Weather CLI (Go)

A minimal command-line application built in Go that fetches and displays real-time weather information using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It takes a ZIP code and country code as input and shows you the current weather, temperature, and wind speed — right in your terminal.
